This is the GameJam 3.0 submission of participant Wilko Thomassen


### Information for the Jury

It went pretty well but at the end I went into panic mode and cut just about 
every possible corner to get it over with

## How the theme is applied

Flame and Frost > intention was to model the flame and frost more like an
actual flame. 

## How the limitations are applied

Multiple endings: Levels get harder and harder to the point where they 
become unbeatable. You never know how far you'r gonna get

## Developed within the GameJam timespan

The game is developed within the timespan of the game, however: 
Knowledge for fieldrendering (perspective play board) is used from another
project I'm working on where I developed the board engine. 
I could show you this referenced material when required.

In my opinion this shouldn't disqualify me. All gameplay, movement logic,
state management, animations (including moving arena at startup) was thought 
out and developed during the game jam time slot. Worked day and night for it

If it does disqualify me then I'll have to accept it, still had a ton of fun
developing it.
